Openning the file with the OpenShot video editor gives the rotational period at the start & and of the video between 8-10 30hz frames.

This implies about 3 - 3.75 rev/sec, or an angular velocity of 18-23 rad/s.

Peroid of the flip is a little less than 3 seconds, for example from 1:21 to 4:04.

Estimating the dimensions from frame 6:

* Handle is about 7cm long
* Handle is about 2cm in diameter
* Shaft is about 4 cm long
* Shaft is about 1 cm in diameter

Both handle and shaft look to be tubes. We will guess they are 1mm thick.

Since only the ratio's matter, we can normalized the values so the smallest moment is 1.

Assume a unity density, the moments are calculated to be:
Input shaft inner, outer, length:.004 .005 .04
Input Handle inner, outer, length:.009 .01 .07
           Moi: 1.91840046394522E-09, 2.85865479317425E-09, 1.34157708276186E-09
Normalized Moi: 1.42995917908486, 2.13081665593842, 1

Using these ratios gives the motion plotted in 3s period.png, which has a period of arround 3s for the flip.
The image 3s period alt w.png shows the exact perturbation to omega doesn't really matter.
